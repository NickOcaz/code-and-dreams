## Aims
The aims of this project is to wish Amy all the best in the future and to acknowledge her as an inspiration throughout our training.
As a token gesture, a digital gift utilising some of our training would be most fitting, especially considering our journey through the training at the Code Institute as Cohort oct-2024-south-york-bootcamp (your fave!) .
